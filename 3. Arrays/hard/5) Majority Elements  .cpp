Output: The majority elements are: 11 33 

Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(N2), where N = size of the given array.
Reason: For every element of the array the inner loop runs for N times. And there are N elements in the array. So, the total time complexity is O(N2).
Space Complexity: O(1) as we are using a list that stores a maximum of 2 elements. The space used is so small that it can be considered constant.



// Better Approach

vector<int> majorityElement(vector<int> v) {
    int n = v.size(); //size of the array
    vector<int> ls; // list of answers
    //declaring a map:
    map<int, int> mpp;

    // least occurrence of the majority element:
    int mini = int(n / 3) + 1;

    //storing the elements with its occurnce:
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        mpp[v[i]]++;

        //checking if v[i] is
        // the majority element:
        if (mpp[v[i]] == mini) {
            ls.push_back(v[i]);
        }
        if (ls.size() == 2) break;
    }
    return ls;
}
Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(N*logN), where N = size of the given array.
Reason: We are using a map data structure. Insertion in the map takes logN time. And we are doing it for N elements. So, it results in the first term O(N*logN).
If we use unordered_map instead, the first term will be O(N) for the best and average case and for the worst case, it will be O(N2).

Space Complexity: O(N) as we are using a map data structure. We are also using a list that stores a maximum of 2 elements. That space used is so small that it can be considered constant.
